# Data access

Please provide information on how the data can be accessed.

The data can be accessed on the website (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002748/versions/1.0.3) and shows 72 subjects in zipped nifti format. Anatomical and functional images (4D).
No derivatives found yet.

I dont know if we have to share our own processed Images. If yes, we are going to search for a suitable space.
Our derivates are not created yet. As far as I know the derivates are saved in SPM as a .mat file. If we work with SPM these files could be shared easy.
